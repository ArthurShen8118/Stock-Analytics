## Motivation
This project presents a deep learning approach to predict which stock is worthy to buy and also to improve the buyersâ€™experience as well as  buyers' confidence. 




## TechStack used


- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


##  Dataset


This dataset consists of __423 customers__ details.

The dataset were collected from the following sources:

* __My freind__ 


## Features
A method to use the dataset to train the prediction model by Artificial Neural Network. Also, we use the test_dataset splited from dataset to do the test and get the good result.

## Results
#### Accuracy: 80.26%
#### Confusion Matrix
